<h2>Intros</h2>
<p>
Cookie Basic is a compilation of basic networking tools that are usefull to learn security related in a beginner stance like mee. Cookie Basic still build on Python 3 per these changes.      Hope it can grow to have more tons of tools built-in that are essentials yet beginner-friendly to others.<br>
