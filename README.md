# cookie-basic
<h2>Intros</h2>
<p>
  Cookie Basic is a compilation of basic networking tools that are usefull to learn networking and network security related in a more beginner stance like mee. Cookie Basic still build 
  on Python 3 per these changes. Hope it can  grow to have more tons of tools built-in that are essentials yet beginner-friendly to others.<br>
</p>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>

  Because Cookie Basic is not a stand-alone program, therefore there are some modules that are required in order for the program to run as expected. We also list other requirements that 
  are related for the program to run properly :<br><br>
